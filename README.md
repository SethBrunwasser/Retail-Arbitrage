# Retail Arbitrage

This is my research to find arbitrage opportunities across various sources.
As of now, the sources will only include sites that users buy and resell items (Offerup, Craigslist, etc.)

TODO:
 - Finalize product match approach
 - Determine which products are best to arbitrage
 	- Average time for products to sell
 	- Most volatile products
